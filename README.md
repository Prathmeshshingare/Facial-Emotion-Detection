Facial Emotion Detection System through Machine Learning


Project Overview:

          This project harnesses the power of machine learning to identify emotions based on facial expressions. By using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), it processes facial images and classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, and anger. The system can be used in a variety of fields, from enhancing security systems to improving customer service interactions, and even monitoring health in medical applications.

Key Features:

           Emotion Recognition: Detects emotions such as happy, sad, surprised, angry, and more from facial images.
           Pre-trained Models: Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models to perform accurate emotion classification.
           Real-time Detection: Analyzes and displays emotions in real-time via webcam input, making it ideal for interactive applications.

           
Technologies Used:
           Python: The primary language for building the system and running the model.
           OpenCV: A library for real-time image processing and capturing webcam feeds.
           Keras: A user-friendly framework for building and training deep learning models.
           TensorFlow: Powers the machine learning models and handles training.
           Matplotlib: Used for visualizing data and results.
           NumPy: Essential for handling numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
